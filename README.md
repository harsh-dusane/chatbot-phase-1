# chatbot-phase-1

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is CoronaBot
#### I am programmed to give Covid19 Info

###### Tech Stack used so far:
Python Flask, RASA NLU, RASA Core, AJAX, HTML, CSS

###### Why Flask?
Flask is a microframework which make core simple but extensible. For the service like chatbot it best suits because it helps making backend light weight.

 ###### Why RASA?
Rasa is an open source machine learning framework for automated text and voice-based conversations. Understand messages, hold conversations, and connect to messaging channels and APIs.
We have also tried ChatterBot which is also being used to built chatbots in python. But as we found the better quality of response in RASA compared to ChatterBot. While response time in RASA is higher.

###### Flask Project Layout
We have followed flask project layout by using reference of flask documentation tutorial. Read more about it [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/layout/)
